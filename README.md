# Programming with C#

## Overview

This is a repository with one of my `first` steps in programming.

Initially I started programming with `C#` but then I switched to `Java`.

The files are just for reference. They have *sentimental value* and __DO NOT__ resemble the state I am with programming... \**chuckles*\*
